		<!--
		We've already added one heading per part, to make your write-up as navigable when grading. Please fit your write-up within these sections!
		-->

		<h2>Overview</h2>
		Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this homework. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the homework.

		<h2>Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>
		<h3>Take some screenshots of scene/pinned2.json from a viewing angle where you can clearly see the cloth wireframe to show the structure of your point masses and springs.</h3>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="part1_0.png" width="400px"/>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="part1_3.png" width="400px"/>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<h3>Show us what the wireframe looks like (1) without any shearing constraints, (2) with only shearing constraints, and (3) with all constraints.</h3>

		<h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
		<h3>Describe the effects of changing the spring constant ks; how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a very low ks? A high ks?</h3>
			
		<h3>What about for density?</h3>
			
		<h3>What about for damping?</h3>
			
		<h3>Show us a screenshot of your shaded cloth from scene/pinned4.json in its final resting state! If you choose to use different parameters than the default ones, please list them.</h3>
		
		<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
		
		<h3>Describe your implementation of handling collisions with spheres and planes.</h3>
		
		<h3>Show us screenshots of your shaded cloth from scene/sphere.json in its final resting state on the sphere using the default ks = 5000 as well as with ks = 500 and ks = 50000. Describe the differences in the results.</h3>

		<h3>Show us a screenshot of your shaded cloth lying peacefully at rest on the plane. If you haven’t by now, feel free to express your colorful creativity with the cloth! (You will need to complete the shaders portion first to show custom colors.)</h3>
		
		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
		<h3>Describe your implementation of handling self-collisions.</h3>
		
		<h3>Show us at least 3 screenshots that document how your cloth falls and folds on itself, starting with an early, initial self-collision and ending with the cloth at a more restful state (even if it is still slightly bouncy on the ground).</h3>
		
		<h3>Vary the density as well as ks and describe with words and screenshots how they affect the behavior of the cloth as it falls on itself.</h3>
		
		<h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
		<h3>Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.</h3>
			
		<h3>Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.</h3>

		<h3>Show a screenshot of your texture mapping shader using your own custom texture by modifying the textures in /textures/.</h3>
			
		<h3>Show a screenshot of bump mapping on the cloth and on the sphere. Show a screenshot of displacement mapping on the sphere. Use the same texture for both renders. You can either provide your own texture or use one of the ones in the textures directory, BUT choose one that’s not the default texture_2.png. Compare the two approaches and resulting renders in your own words. Compare how your the two shaders react to the sphere by changing the sphere mesh’s coarseness by using -o 16 -a 16 and then -o 128 -a 128.</h3>
			
		<h3>Show a screenshot of your mirror shader on the cloth and on the sphere.</h3>

		<h2>Additional Notes (please remove)</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>You can also add code if you'd like as so: <code>code code code</code></li>
			<li>If you'd like to add math equations, 
				<ul>
					<li>You can write inline equations like so: \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \)</li>
					<li>You can write display equations like so: \[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \]</li>
				</ul>
